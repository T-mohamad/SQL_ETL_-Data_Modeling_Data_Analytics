# Data Modeling Explanation with Schema Diagram

## 1. What is Data Modeling?
Data modeling is the process of designing the structure of your data so that it can be stored, queried, and analyzed efficiently. In analytics,
we often use **Star Schema** or **Snowflake Schema** to organize data.

- **Fact Table** → contains measurable, quantitative data (e.g., sales, revenue, quantity).
- **Dimension Tables** → contain descriptive attributes (e.g., customer info, product details) that provide context to the facts.

## 2. Our Example Schema
We created:
- **FactSales** → sales transactions
- **DimCustomer** → customer information
- **DimProduct** → product catalog

### Relationships
- `FactSales.CustomerID` → references `DimCustomer.CustomerID`
- `FactSales.ProductID` → references `DimProduct.ProductID`

                |------------------|
                | CustomerID (PK)  |
                | Name             |
                | Email            |
                | Phone            |
                | Country          |
                +------------------+
                       |
                       | (FK)
                       |
+------------------+    |     +------------------+
|   FactSales      |----+-----|   DimProduct     |
|------------------|          |------------------|
| SaleID (PK)      |          | ProductID (PK)   |
| CustomerID (FK)  |          | ProductName      |
| ProductID (FK)   |          | Category         |
| SaleDate         |          | Price            |
| Quantity         |          | Status           |
| UnitPrice        |          +------------------+
| Discount         |
| TotalAmount      |
+------------------+

## 4. Why This Model Works
- **FactSales** is the central table with numeric measures.
- **DimCustomer** and **DimProduct** provide descriptive context.
- Queries can join facts with dimensions to answer business questions:
  - *Which customers spent the most?*
  - *Which products generated the highest revenue?*
  - *Sales trends by country or category.*

---

## 5. Example Queries

### Total Sales by Country
```sql
SELECT c.Country, SUM(f.TotalAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM FactSales f
JOIN DimCustomer c ON f.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.Country;


Top 5 Products by Revenue
SELECT p.ProductName, SUM(f.TotalAmount) AS Revenue
FROM FactSales f
JOIN DimProduct p ON f.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductName
ORDER BY Revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
